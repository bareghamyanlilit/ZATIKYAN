        question: "Do I need a referral to see a physical therapist?", 
        answer: "In some cases, you may need a referral from your primary care physician or a specialist to see a physical therapist, depending on your location and insurance requirements. However, many states allow direct access to physical therapy, meaning you can see a physical therapist without a referral. It’s always best to check with your insurance provider and local regulations to understand the requirements for your specific situation."

        question: "Is physical therapy painful?", 
        answer: "Physical therapy involves exercises and treatments designed to improve movement and function. While it can involve some discomfort, especially if you are recovering from an injury or surgery, it should never be excessively painful. The goal is to help your body heal, strengthen, and function better over time. Your therapist will work with you to ensure that treatments are adjusted to your comfort level and that any pain you experience is manageable."

    { 
        question: "What should I bring to my first appointment?", 
        answer: "When attending your first physical therapy session, you should bring a few important items with you. These include your ID, insurance card, and any medical records related to your condition. If you have previous imaging results, such as X-rays or MRIs, bring those along as well. It’s also a good idea to wear comfortable clothing that allows easy movement, as the therapist may have you perform exercises or stretches during the session."
